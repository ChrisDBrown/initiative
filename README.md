# initiative

Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition initiative tracker.

Basic idea here is the DM can set this up on an admin screen, with a second screen (an iPad in our case) showing the turn order, current turn, statuses etc.

Currently extremely basic as I came up with the idea the night before a session and hacked it all together instead of doing actual prep.
